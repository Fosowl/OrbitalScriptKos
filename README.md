# Orbital Script for Kerbal Space Program "Kos" mod

Since my youngest age was I passionate about rocket, airplane and everything related to space or the sky.. Later I discovered an interest for computer science, a more accesible hobby, my passion for space was left behind until I discovered the "Kerbal Operating System" mod for KSP...

I found a way to combine what I was good at with what I was most fascinated about, and this tiny `.ks` file is one of my best creation using KOS.

Good Luck !
