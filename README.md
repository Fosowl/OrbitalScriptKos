# Orbital Script for Kerbal Space Program "Kos" mod

Since my youngest age was I passionate about rocket, airplane and everything related to space or the sky.. Later I discovered an interest for computer science, a more accesible hobby, my passion for space was left behind until I discovered the "Kerbal Operating System" mod for KSP...

I found a way to combine what I was good at with what I was most fascinated about, and this tiny `.ks` file is one of my best creation using KOS.

If you didn't know about KOS check [this](https://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS/) link.

The script has realtime verbose to display in-flight information, ability to recover from error, and even use audio capability of the mod so you can go get a coffee while your rocket make it to orbit.

This is a "work in progress" that I may finish someday, some function of the function or variable may not even be used (:

Good Luck !
